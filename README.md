# Work-Day-Planner


## **DESCRIPTION**

The Work-Day-Planner could be used on a regular basis to create a schedule. When the user opens the planner, the current date, day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, time blocks are presented for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future (grey, red, green). When the user clicks into a time block, it enables the user to enter an event. upon cliking the save button for that time block, the event (text) for that time block is saved in local storage. The saved event persists, even upon refreshing.
